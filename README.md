# softmax_estmating_parameters
Estimating the thetas using 
1) Gradient Descent, 
2) Stochastic Gradient Descent 
3) Mini-batch Gradient Descent and 
4) Newton Raphson Method (using Quasi Methods) and Backtracking Linesearch

Notebook does not use Scikit learn's functions but I have coded all of them into the notebook. All references are also mentioned. Give it a try and report any bugs.
